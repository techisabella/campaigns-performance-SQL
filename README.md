In November 2021, I successfully completed my 8 weeksâ€™ SQL course with Code First Girls.

The topics covered during my course were as follows:
SQL coding and Database management techniques
Data analysis
Data manipulation
Data management using SQL coding techniques
Database design and data visualisation
Project presentation

As part of this course,I ideated and presented an SQL project that focused on analysing the performance of marketing campaigns.

With this project, I hypothesised a scenario where a marketing department has accelerated its growth due to the creation of a large number of campaigns and has too much data to deal with. Considering the limitation of traditional methods such as Excel, I recommended the department to use SQL instead of Excel to successfully manipulate, measure & extract data. Additionally, these data could be used in 3rd party dashboards such as Tableau.
